Zip codes in the United States are organized geographically, with the first digit typically indicating a broad region or group of states.

Generally, the East Coast, which includes states such as New York, New Jersey, and Florida, tends to have a higher density of zip codes compared to the West Coast, encompassing states like California, Oregon, and Washington.

This difference in zip code allocation is primarily driven by population density and geographical factors. The East Coast is more densely populated and has a higher concentration of urban centers, resulting in the need for more zip codes to efficiently manage mail delivery and address assignments. In contrast, the West Coast has larger expanses of rural and sparsely populated areas, leading to fewer zip codes overall.

Additionally, the East Coast has a longer history of urban development and settlement compared to the West Coast, which has influenced the distribution and density of zip codes over time.

Of the three species of penguins, gentoo penguins have the biggest body mass, hence there might be fewer outliers indicating extraordinary individuals with noticeably greater body masses. In contrast, Chinstrap and Adelie penguins may have greater body mass variability than Gentoo penguins due to their smaller body masses. This could result in an increased frequency of outliers, which are individuals with body masses that are noticeably higher or lower than the species median.
