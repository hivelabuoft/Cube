You will be given a page of different shapes to study. After you have had some time to learn the shapes and their orientation, you will be asked to turn to a test page which will show some of the same shapes that you studied. For each picture on the test page you will be asked whether it is the same as the one in the study page or whether it is different from those you studied.



Now look at this sample:

  

After you have studied the sample above for about a minute, turn to the next page.","For each sample item mark the Y (Yes) if the item shows part of the picture you studied or the N (No) if the picture is not one you studied.



  

      I. Y N              II. Y N            III. Y N



You should have marked the N on the answer sheet for item I, Y for item II, and Y for item III.



Remember the test items will show only a small part of the picture that was studied. Mark the Y for items that show the same shapes in the same orientation as on the study picture. Mark the N for items that show different shapes.



Your score on this test will be the number of items you mark right minus the number wrong. Therefore, it will not be to your advantage to guess if you are unsure about an answer.



There are two sections for each part of this test. The first of these is a study page for you to study for 2 minutes. The second part is the test section and contains 16 items.
